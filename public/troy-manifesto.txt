<h1>Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Troy, I build brands and startups.</h1>
I create cinematic content on self-mastery fitness & wellness. 
My goal is to empower creators and founders to turn their struggles into success.
Ive been building my personal brand since 2016, and I've worked on
multiple early-stage startups in areas like crypto, AI, and mobile gaming. Through
that experience, Ive realized that building a brand and building startups have much i n common.

<h1>What I do and why.</h1>

I create content because, at one point in my life, I saw myself suffer, and I decided
to take action. I came from a place of struggleâ€”mentally, emotionally, financially,
and physically. I felt like I had no control over many aspects of my life but failed to
realize that I was always in control of how I think.
My content strategy, Stories of Struggle, showcases how I overcame numerous
hurdles in my life by sharing the strategies that helped me rise above them.
<h1>Core Values</h1>

<h2>Hard Work</h2>
If anyone can hide behind anything, its the undeniable stack of proof that you are
who you say you are: hard work. I honor hard work because its the bare minimum
currency for anyone to prove they can get things done.
A person who can reduce the amount of time between an idea and execution is a
hardworking person. Thats what hard work looks likeâ€”showing up and getting
things done without excuses.

<h2>Integrity</h2>
A persons word means everything. This value holds everything togetherâ€”its the
standard for my brand.
Regarding commitment, honor, or anything monetary, integrity is about aligning
your words with your actions. Being accountable for what you say and do is the
foundation for trust. Without integrity, theres nothing to build on.

<h1>The Hills I Will Die On</h1>

<h2>Volume is Key</h2>
Producing outputâ€”not just in volume but consistentlyâ€”is what keeps everything
cohesive. Its what builds the undeniable proof of work. Volume shows dedication and
effort, and its the ultimate way to build a bulletproof stack of work.

<h2> Authenticity is a Word</h2>
Content has to resonate with who I am and come from my past experiences. It
needs to stay away from scripted, generic, or clichÃ© ideas. If the content isnt close to
who I am as a person, its not authenticâ€”and authenticity is non-negotiable for me.

<h2> Storytelling is the Journey</h2>
Sell the story, not the product. The story is made up of ups and downs, wins and
losses. Thats what creates emotion, and emotion is what makes people care. Whether
they love it or hate it, a story connects with people, and connection is everything.


<h1>At The Core</h1>
I'm a Christian, and I believe the Bible is the ultimate source of truth. My
content is rooted in a simple yet powerful principle: renewing the mind is a daily
practice essential to becoming a better person.

Romans 12:2 states:
"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the
renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what
God's will isâ€”his good, pleasing, and perfect will."

<h1>Theme</h1>

I see self-mastery as the layer above mind renewalâ€”a term borrowed from
software development, emphasizing how one concept is built upon another.
Self-mastery is the practical, continuous action point of mind renewal, which, in
essence, is about aligning our thoughts with the Word of God. The value I create
on Instagram reflects years of studying the Bible, offering content deeply rooted in
biblical principles.

My vision isn't to hard-sell my beliefs but to demonstrate that theres more to life
than surface-level â€œself-help and â€œpsychology-fixing related concepts. I firmly
believe the Bible is the ultimate source of truth, and Jesus is the truth. The
undertone of my content naturally reflects these biblical principles and values.

My goal is to speak life and encourage others through the lens of self-mastery,
all while embodying the tone and teachings of the Bible. I achieve this by sharing
my own experiences and the strategies I used to overcome challenges.
For those who dont share my faith, my content may come across as â€œhard work,
â€œresilience, or even â€œluck. But that doesnt change the reality: the stories of my
lifeâ€”and everyonesâ€”are divinely orchestrated by God.

<h1>Theology (my belief about God)</h1>
On a theological level (which is incredibly in the context of the content I
create): I dont believe that God means to ever harm or kill people. God
allows things to happen, but He also calls His people to take action.
Throughout scripture, Christians are commanded and encouraged to use
the Wordâ€”not just the written Word (logos), but the spoken Word (Rhema),
which brings faith to life. Faith isnt just something we believe; its something
we speak and act upon in obedience.

Bad things happen all the time, and I cant always account for the reasoning.
But what I do know is this: God is good, and God is love. Even when bad
things happen, we still exalt His name. That doesnt mean we sit passively.
Taking action in faith means speaking Gods Word, aligning our thoughts to
it, staying sharp in scripture, and seeking Him through prayer and praise.

Romans 8:28 NIV
"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those
who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."
To make this crystal clear: bad things may seem big, but the God I serve is
bigger.


<h1>The Journey</h1>
With my stance on theology explained, I understand that everyone is on
their own journey in life. No matter how far along we are in our faith, God
desires to know us because His love for us is unconditional. That said,
sometimes, we make mistakes or lose our way.

My approach to treating others is rooted in this understanding: everyones
journey is unique, and we are all seeking answers in our own time and way.
So, I let my content speak life to other people.


<h1>The Origin</h1>
My content creation journey began as a photographer. I started by posting
pictures and experimenting with digital art, diving into Photoshop and
composites. It was a fun, creative outlet, but eventually, I needed to make
money. That led me to videography, where I became a freelance filmmaker,
taking on all kinds of projectsâ€”weddings, corporate gigs, birthdays, and
small events. These jobs helped me gain experience and earn some cash,
but over time, I realized they werent fulfilling. I wanted more.

But what was that more?

This desire for â€œmore evolved into vlogging my daily life (back in 2017,
when everyone was vlogging). The problem was, I didnt have a solid
content pillar. I was just documenting my life without offering much value. I
knew there had to be a â€œtake-home factorâ€”something people could learn
or gain from my content. I tried tutorials and tips, but it all felt forced and
inauthentic. Frustrated, I eventually stopped creating altogether.
When the pandemic hit, I decided to try YouTube again. This time, I was
vocal about my faith, sharing scripture and discussing the Bible. While I
resonated deeply with what I was creating, the process felt unsustainable.
Everything took so long to produce, and I found myself procrastinating. It
didnt help that the content didnt seem to connect with a wider audience.
Thats when I started searching for something differentâ€”something people
could relate to but that also felt authentic to me. I wanted to create without
overthinking how it would be received. Around this time, I was consuming a
lot of short-form guitar tutorial content, and it clicked: short-form content
was something I could experiment with and enjoy.
Thats where the next chapter of my journey began.


<h1>Belief</h1>
People relating to stories is the ultimate form of getting a message across.
Its human to cry and relate to the loss of another.
Im not the best when it comes to technical skills. Growing up, I failed at a lot in
lifeâ€”bad grades, no talent, no clear direction. It felt like I couldnt get anything
right. But from the pile of ashes that are my failures, one thing emerged: my love
for sharing stories. Ive realized that my vivid memories and life experiences are
valuable because they allow me to share lessons and help others avoid making the
same mistakes.

When it comes to content, Im naturally drawn to sharing failures over successes.
Why? Because failures are relatable. They resonate with people on a deeper level.
But I dont stop thereâ€”I work hard to create an undeniable stack of proof that Im
not just the sum of my failures. Instead, I see myself as a stack of failures building
the foundation for success.

My stories all carry the same core message: I have failed, I have suffered, but I
refuse to stay down. I choose to get up, move forward, and not remain in a place of
suffering.

Although my content takes on different forms, its always the same message
repackaged in countless ways, which gives me endless ideas to create from.
These stories are mine, but I know they resonate with many because failures are
universal. Lets face it: winning isnt for everyone all the time. But I believe that a
stack of failures can become undeniable proof of who you are and what youre
capable of.

I focus on failures because they connect with people. Sharing too many wins
without the context of struggle can feel inauthentic. Struggles give success its
meaningâ€”they show the journey.

And my call to action? Its simple: take action. Start building habits, find
communities, and create routines that strengthen and bulletproof your mindset.
Thats the message I want to leave my audience with.
